# Axial SQL Tools | SQL Server Management Studio 21 Productivity Addin

As an engineer with over two decades of experience in SQL Server, I've encountered my fair share of inefficiencies and limitations within SSMS. 
Motivated by these challenges, I started developing the SSMS extension back in 2016. This repository represents the fourth iteration of my work, tailored specifically for SSMS 21.
This project is a personal endeavor to solve the issues I've faced, but I would like to incorporate valuable community feedback and ideas as well.

While I recognize that this extension may overlap with existing tools, both free and paid, my passion lies in coding and tackling problems in my own unique way. The aim isn't to overshadow other solutions but to provide a complementary tool that addresses gaps and simplifies processes for engineers like myself.

I'm committed to keeping this tool free and openly available to the community. While formalized support won't be provided, I welcome feedback and suggestions to continually improve and evolve the tool based on user needs. 

If you find this extension useful and it helps streamline your workflow in SSMS, please consider giving it a :star: star on the repository. Your support not only motivates me but also helps others in the community discover this tool. 

Check it out and let me know what you think!

These templates are designed to cover a wide range of scenarios, helping you to execute complex tasks faster.

To install the addin, you have two options:

1. **Compile from Source:** If you prefer to compile the tool from the source code, please ensure you are using Visual Studio 2022 for compatibility. 
The build process will automatically copy all necessary files into the SSMS extension folder, and you will be ready to use it.

2. **Download the Release:** For a quicker setup, download the most recent version from the [Releases](https://github.com/Axial-SQL/AxialSqlTools/releases) section of this GitHub repository.

After obtaining the compiled files (either by compiling from source or downloading from Releases), place the folder with the compiled files into the following directory:
`C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 21\Release\Common7\IDE\Extensions`
